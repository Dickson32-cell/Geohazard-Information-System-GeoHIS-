# Abdul Rashid Dickson 3D Portfolio - Copilot Instructions

This is a React + TypeScript 3D portfolio website project for Abdul Rashid Dickson.

## Project Context
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Framework**: React.js with Create React App
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js & React Three Fiber
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (webpack)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety where possible
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow component-based architecture
- Use proper error handling and loading states

## File Structure Conventions
- Place components in `src/components/`
- Place data in `src/data/`
- Place styles in `src/styles/`
- Place 3D scenes in `src/three/`
- Test files should mirror src structure

## Component Design Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use responsive design principles
- Optimize 3D performance

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for components
- Test user interactions
- Mock 3D libraries when necessary
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize 3D rendering performance
- Use lazy loading for components
- Minimize bundle size
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use React.memo for expensive components
